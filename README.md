# A Dynamic Themed Store: My Submission for the React JS Dev Role

Hello,

This repository, available at **[https://github.com/Venkatsai04/Multi-Theme-Switcher-App-](https://github.com/Venkatsai04/Multi-Theme-Switcher-App-)**, contains my submission for the React JS Developer role. I've built a modern, responsive storefront that showcases a clean UI, dynamic data, and a flexible architecture. The core idea was to create an app that doesn’t just work—it changes its entire personality with a single click. I hope you enjoy exploring it!

I focused on a few key areas to demonstrate a solid understanding of modern React development practices:

### The Best Parts:

* **A Wardrobe for the App:** The app has three distinct themes—Minimalist, Dark, and Modern—that you can switch between instantly. It's not just a color change; the entire layout and typography adapt to create a unique feel for each theme.
* **A Dynamic Home Page:** The product grid isn’t just a simple list. It's a responsive, asymmetrical grid that changes its pattern for each theme, just like the layouts you sketched out. This provides a much more engaging and visually interesting user experience.
* **Real-ish Products:** The products you see are fetched asynchronously from a public API (`fakestoreapi.com`), complete with loading and error handling. This demonstrates practical data-fetching skills.
* **Clean Code & State Management:** The entire application state, particularly the theme, is managed with Redux Toolkit, keeping the codebase predictable and easy to scale.

### Ready to Run it Yourself?

It's a breeze to get this running on your local machine.

#### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14 or higher)
* npm or yarn

#### Let's Get Started!

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Venkatsai04/Multi-Theme-Switcher-App-.git](https://github.com/Venkatsai04/Multi-Theme-Switcher-App-.git)
    cd Multi-Theme-Switcher-App-
    ```
2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Fire up the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:5173`.

### The Ingredients:

* **React & TypeScript:** The foundation of the app, ensuring type-safety and robust component architecture.
* **Redux Toolkit:** My choice for state management, providing a predictable and efficient way to handle the themes.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For the lightning-fast, utility-first styling that made the dynamic layouts a joy to build.
* **Vite:** The powerful and speedy bundler that makes the development experience truly excellent.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I'm always open to new challenges and conversations about all things React!

Best regards,

**Venkat Sai Utharadhi**
